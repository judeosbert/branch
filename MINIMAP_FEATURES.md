# MiniMap Graph Visualization Feature

## Overview

The MiniMap component provides a visual graph representation of the conversation structure, allowing users to see and navigate through all branches in their conversation. It appears as a floating mini-map in the top-right corner and can be expanded to full-screen view.

## Key Features

### üó∫Ô∏è **Visual Graph Representation**
- **Nodes**: Each conversation branch is represented as a colored rectangle
- **Connections**: Lines show the relationship between branches
- **Hierarchy**: Visual depth shows nested branch levels
- **Active Highlighting**: Current branch is highlighted in blue

### üé® **Color Coding**
- **Blue**: Active/current branch
- **Green**: Main chat conversation
- **Gray**: Inactive branches
- **Animated Connections**: Active paths are highlighted with thicker lines

### üìä **Node Information**
- **Branch Label**: "Branch 1", "Branch 2", etc.
- **Branch Summary**: First 40 characters of the branching text
- **Message Count**: Number of messages in each branch
- **Visual Icons**: Different icons for main chat vs. branches

### üîç **Two View Modes**

#### **Mini View (Default)**
- Compact floating widget in top-right corner
- Quick overview of conversation structure
- Click to expand to full view
- Shows branch count and basic navigation

#### **Full View (Expanded)**
- Full-screen overlay with detailed graph
- Larger nodes with more information
- Interactive navigation
- Legend explaining color coding
- Close button to return to mini view

### üéØ **Interactive Features**

#### **Navigation**
- **Click any node**: Navigate to that branch/conversation
- **Auto-close**: Full view closes when navigating to a branch
- **Breadcrumb integration**: Updates breadcrumb path when navigating

#### **Hover Effects**
- Nodes highlight on hover
- Drop shadows for better visual feedback
- Smooth transitions and animations

#### **Responsive Design**
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Maintains readability at all zoom levels
- Proper overflow handling

### üéûÔ∏è **Animations**
- **Slide-in**: Mini-map appears with smooth animation
- **Fade-in**: Full view overlay appears smoothly
- **Scale-in**: Full view content scales in with bounce effect
- **Transitions**: All state changes are smoothly animated

### üßÆ **Graph Layout Algorithm**
- **Horizontal Layout**: Branches extend to the right
- **Vertical Spacing**: Branches at same depth are spaced vertically
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Graph adapts to number of branches
- **Collision Avoidance**: Nodes are positioned to avoid overlap

## Usage Instructions

### **Creating and Viewing Branches**
1. Start a conversation in the main chat
2. Select text and click "Branch from here"
3. The mini-map will appear in the top-right corner
4. Continue creating branches to see the graph grow

### **Navigating with Mini-Map**
1. **Mini View**: Click the expand button to see full graph
2. **Full View**: Click any node to jump to that conversation
3. **Return**: Use the close button or navigate to return to mini view

### **Understanding the Graph**
- **Main Chat**: Green node on the left (starting point)
- **Branches**: Gray nodes connected to their parent
- **Active Branch**: Blue node showing current location
- **Connections**: Lines show branching relationships

## Technical Implementation

### **Component Structure**
```
MiniMap Component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ State Management (node positions, hover states)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Graph Calculation (layout algorithm)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SVG Rendering (nodes, connections, animations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Event Handling (click, hover, navigation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Responsive Views (mini vs full view)
```

### **Key Functions**
- `calculateNodes()`: Computes node positions and graph layout
- `generatePath()`: Creates SVG paths for connections
- `handleNodeClick()`: Manages navigation and view switching
- `renderNode()`: Renders individual branch nodes
- `renderConnections()`: Renders connecting lines

### **Integration Points**
- **ChatInterface**: Hosts the mini-map component
- **App.tsx**: Provides branch data and navigation handlers
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth transitions and effects
- **Type System**: Proper TypeScript interfaces

## Benefits

### **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Spatial Awareness**: Users always know where they are
- **Quick Navigation**: Jump to any branch instantly
- **Visual Overview**: See entire conversation structure at once
- **Professional Feel**: Polished animations and interactions

### **Improved Navigation**
- **No More Lost Branches**: All branches are visible
- **Easy Exploration**: Encourage users to create more branches
- **Context Preservation**: Understand branch relationships
- **Efficient Switching**: Fast navigation between conversations

### **Visual Clarity**
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Understand branch depth and relationships
- **Status Indicators**: Know which branch is active
- **Progress Tracking**: See message counts in each branch
- **Interactive Feedback**: Hover and click effects

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
- **Drag and Drop**: Reorganize branch structure
- **Zoom Controls**: Zoom in/out of large graphs
- **Search**: Find specific branches by content
- **Export**: Export graph as image
- **Branch Merging**: Combine branches back into main chat
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys for navigation

### **Advanced Interactions**
- **Multi-select**: Select multiple branches
- **Bulk Operations**: Delete or merge multiple branches
- **Branch Comparison**: Compare different branch outcomes
- **Timeline View**: See branch creation chronologically

The MiniMap feature transforms the branching conversation interface from a linear experience into a true graph-based navigation system, making it easy and intuitive to explore complex conversation structures.
