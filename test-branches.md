# Testing Branch Navigation and Display

## Test Cases

### 1. Main Chat Branch Display
- [ ] Start a conversation in main chat
- [ ] Select text and create a branch
- [ ] Verify branch appears in main chat with proper indicator
- [ ] Navigate to branch and verify context

### 2. Nested Branch Creation
- [ ] Create a branch from main chat
- [ ] In the branch, create another nested branch
- [ ] Navigate back to main chat
- [ ] Verify both branches are visible (direct and nested)

### 3. Branch Navigation
- [ ] Navigate from main chat to branch
- [ ] Use breadcrumb to navigate back to main chat
- [ ] Verify all branches are still visible after navigation
- [ ] Test navigation to nested branches

### 4. Branch Hierarchy Display
- [ ] Create multiple levels of nested branches
- [ ] Verify proper visual hierarchy in branch indicators
- [ ] Test that branch levels are properly labeled
- [ ] Check that nested branches show correct parent relationships

## Expected Behavior

1. **Main Chat View**: Should show all available branches, including nested ones
2. **Branch Indicators**: Should clearly distinguish between direct and nested branches
3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Should show the full path to current branch
4. **Context Preservation**: When navigating back to main chat, all branches should remain visible
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Nested branches should be visually distinct from direct branches

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Removed duplicate sendMessage function** in mockAIService.ts
2. **Enhanced BranchIndicator component** to show nested branches with proper hierarchy
3. **Improved message filtering** to handle nested branch navigation
4. **Added getVisibleBranches function** to control which branches are displayed
5. **Enhanced breadcrumb navigation** for better nested branch path display
6. **Added visual context indicator** when viewing branches
7. **Fixed PostCSS configuration** for proper ES module support

## Features

- **Smart Branch Display**: Shows all branches in main chat, including deeply nested ones
- **Hierarchical Indicators**: Clear visual distinction between direct and nested branches
- **Contextual Navigation**: Breadcrumbs show the full path to current location
- **Preserved Context**: Branch availability is maintained when navigating back to main chat
- **Enhanced UI**: Better visual indicators for branch levels and relationships
